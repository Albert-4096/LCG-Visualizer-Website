This is a website that allows a user to play around with LCG formulas, compute their grayscale image (and determine if there are any recurring patterns) and verify the variables against the Hull-Dobell Theorem.

To deploy locally, do:
```
git clone https://github.com/Albert-4096/LCG-Visualizer-Website.git
cd LCG-Visualizer-Website
```

Then, build the docker image and run it:

```
docker compose up --build -d
```

That's it! Now navigate to [http://localhost](http://localhost)
